BUGS:

- the alpha is not working
- the leaves issue

TODO:

1. add collision and gravity
2. add raycast block break (i guess the raycast will return the cordinates of collision, then we remove the block from its cordinates)
3. add block place
4. add grass
5. add water
6. add a menu gui
7. make a site and launch
